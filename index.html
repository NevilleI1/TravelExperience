<h2><strong>Japan</strong></h2>
    <p>Around 2022 I went on a trip to Japan for a week. It was one of the most beautiful places I have visited. The temple below Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion) is one of the temples i visted on my trip. Although you aren't allowed in it, it is a beautiful sight from outside. <br> The city life in Japan is also exciting with various different places to visit and experience with people.</p>

<h2><strong>Bangladesh</strong></h2>
    <p>My family comes from Bangladesh a small country in Asia. In Bangladesh the culture and way of living is comepletely different. Although it is not the cleanest of places, the energy is unmatched and everyone is close with one another.</p>

<h2><strong>United States</strong></h2>
	<p>The United States has tons of beautiful states that people should visit. <br>My top picks would be Hawaii and Alaska. They're completely different from eachother and have a wide variety of sights to see. In Hawaii I would recommend not spending to long in Honululu due to the crowds or just go during a time when there is not to many people.</br> The other islands such as Big Island is a beautiful place to go to as well. For Alaska I would rent a car and go around to experience what the state has to offer and take a cruise to the glaciers. <br>
